  <p>Hey there!</p>
  <p>We're glad you're enjoying our site, but we've noticed that your adblocker is still on. We know ads aren't the most exciting thing in the world, but they do help us keep the lights on and the site running.</p>
  <p>We promise we won't show you any ads for things you don't need (like a pet rock, for example), but we will show you ads for things we think you might like (like a coffee subscription to keep you going).</p>
  <p>So go ahead, disable that adblocker, and let's keep the good times rolling. Who knows, you might even find your next favorite thing in one of our ads.</p>
  <p>Thanks for being a part of our community!</p>
